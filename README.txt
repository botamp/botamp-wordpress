Marketing automation for messaging apps. Run personalized messaging campaigns at scale, increase your audience and revenue.

== Description ==

Messaging apps have quickly become the most popular online communication medium, more than email and social media.
Botamp aims to help small businesses and ecommerce companies to sell their products and services in the most efficient way
via messaging apps.

Botamp is a marketing automation solution that lets you broadcast personalized messages to a large number of customers,
run polls and surveys, schedule appointments, run marketing campaigns, etc.
It takes the proven methods from other marketing channels and adapts them to the conversational interfaces.

The Botamp plugin for WordPress makes it easy to engage your customers by using content from your website.

This plugin uses the [Botamp PHP SDK](https://github.com/botamp/botamp-php),
to interact with the [Botamp API](https://app.botamp.com/docs/api).

= Features =

* Posts, pages or custom post types syncing from your website to Botamp.
* Syncing on content creation, update and deletion.
* Integration of your Botamp optins to your pages
* Woocommerce integration.
* Notification on Woocommerce checkout and order status change.
* Customers subscription/unsubscription from notifications.
