One-click chatbots for your business. The easiest way to automate your interactions with more than 1 billion potential customers.

== Description ==

Botamp is an autonomous AI-enabled chat assistant which interacts seamlessly with your customers, keeps them engaged and makes them buy more from you, while you can focus on serving them.

The Botamp plugin for WordPress makes it easy to send content to your bot and your bot will use the content to respond to users.

This plugin uses the [Botamp PHP SDK](https://github.com/botamp/botamp-php), to interact with the [Botamp API](https://app.botamp.com/docs/api).

Requires PHP version 5.6 or greater.
